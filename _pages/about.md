Welcome to my website! I'm Hossam, a PhD student at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Prof. N. Asokan](https://asokan.org/asokan/). My background is originally in electronics, but I shifted more towards computer architecture during my Master's. After that, I worked at Mentor Graphics (now part of Siemens) as a C++ SW developer for 5 years before starting my PhD.

My current research is on hardware-assisted security mechanisms, including trusted execution environments, memory safety and side-channel resistance. The main project I'm working on is BliMe {% cite blime24 %}, which enables secure side-channel-resistant outsourced computation, even when all software running on the server is malicious. You can read more about it [here](https://ssg-research.github.io/platsec/blime).

My skills span both hardware and software. My previous job had a lot of C/C++ development (ranging from USB drivers to GUI work), and my current project has me doing a lot of Chisel/Verilog, assembly and C++.
